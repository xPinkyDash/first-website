    <p>This website serves to provide meaningful and interesting content pertaining to otaku culture. This includes, but is not limited to, essays on anime, manga, and light novels, patch files for torrents, and various guides and services usually not found elsewhere. We do NOT do any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>provide inherently illegal material</li>
        <li>hurt others</li>
        <li>talk shit about attack on titan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and we want you to not do any of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>steal any of the content here and market it as your own</li>
        <li>DDoS attack us</li>
        <li>claim that attack on titan is a bad anime</li>
    </ol>
